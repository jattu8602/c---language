                             INHERITANCE IN Cpp
overview-
1.>reusability is a very important feature of oops.

2.>in c++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it.

3.>reusing classes saves time and money.

4.>reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the
   same thing again.     

What is inheritance in C++?
1.>the concept of reusability in c++ is supported using inheritance.
2.>we can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheritance from it.
3.>the existing class is called as the base class.
4.>the new class which is inherited is called as the derived class.
5.>reusing class saves time and money.
6.>there are different types of inheritance in c++.
       i.>SINGLE INHERITANCE

        a derived class with only one base class.

       ii.>MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
        
        a derived class with more than one base class.

       iii.>HIERACHICAL INHERITANCE 

         several derived class from a single base class.

       iv.>MULTI LEVEL INHERITANCE

       deriving a class form already derived class.

       v.>HYBRID INHERITANCE

       hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multi level inheritance.

       a class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.

       However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
