/*
STL
containers,algorithms,iterators
container is an object which processes data
alogorithm is a procedure to store data
iterator iterates data (which points an element of a container)

CONTAINERS
it has three types:-
1.sequence containers
sequence containers stores data in linear fashion.
examples: vectors,list,dequeue,

2.associative containers
direct access (map , multimap)(set, multiset)
(fast searching,deletion,access)
stores data in tree like structure

3.derived containers
they are derived from sequence containers and multi conationers
real world modelling
ex: stack, queue, priority queue
