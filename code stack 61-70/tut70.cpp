/*
STL
containers,algorithms,iterators
container is an object which processes data
alogorithm is a procedure to store data
iterator iterates data (which points an element of a container)

CONTAINERS
it has three types:-
          1.sequence containers
sequence containers stores data in linear fashion.
examples: vectors,list,dequeue,
          1.vector
random excess fast
in middile of stack insertion deletion slow(we have to work manually in it)
insertion at the end = fast
          2.list
random excess slow
insertion in middile fast
insertion at the end is fast



                2.associative containers
direct access (map , multimap)(set, multiset)
(fast searching,deletion,access)
stores data in tree like structure
insertion in middile and at the end of insertion and deletion fast
random excess is slow



                  3.derived containers
they are derived from sequence containers and multi conationers
real world modelling
ex: stack, queue, priority queue
depends (in data structure)
