/*
INTRODUCTION TO STL
for competitive programming(limited time)
list shorting
resizable array
search


STL
standard template library(full form)
in its library there is generic classes and functions are there
why we use stl?
we are reusing well tested components


two employees of HP company have done (alex and mangly)
it is time saving!

COMPONENTS OF STL
1.containers->stores data(uses template classes)
2.algorithms->shorting, searching, (uses template functions)
3.iterators->its is a object(points to an element in a container)
(handles just like pointers)(connects algorithms with containers)

stl is used because its a good idea not to reinvent the wheel.

let a container be here
containing some elements
now we have to short conationer
we will be doing it by iterators
