/*
                      POLYMORPHISM
->poly=many
->morfism=forms
->basically porymorphism means many forms(of anything)
->one name multiple forms is also a example of polymorphism
->eg: function overloading, operator overloading

->two types are there :-
                    1.> run time polymorphism

->it is achieved by virtual functions    
->it differs type of function while running

1.>virtual functions



                    2.>compile time polymorphism

->it is a simple polymorphism
->object bounds with function call
->it is also called early binding
->it is also called as static binding

1.>function overloading
2.>operator overloading
